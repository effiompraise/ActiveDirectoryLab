<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The primary goal of this project was to design, build, and optimize an Active Directory (AD) home lab environment that closely simulates a real-world enterprise network. This hands-on lab allowed me to gain invaluable experience in managing user accounts, group policies, security protocols, and network configurations.
<br />

<h2>Key Achievements</h2>

- <b>Infrastructure Setup:</b> <p>I meticulously set up a virtualized environment using Oracle VirtualBox, emulating multiple servers and workstations. This allowed me to create a self-contained AD network without the need for physical hardware.</p> 
- <b>Active Directory Deployment:</b> <p>I configured and deployed Windows Server as domain controllers, successfully establishing an Active Directory forest, domain, and organizational units (OUs).</p>
- <b>High Availability and Redundancy:</b> <p>To showcase my knowledge of best practices, I implemented fault tolerance mechanisms, such as backup domain controllers and data replication.</p>
- <b>User Management:</b> <p>I created and managed user accounts, granting them various permissions and roles, to mimic real-world scenarios. This involved user provisioning, password policies, and group memberships.</p>
- <b>Group Policy Management:</b> <p>To demonstrate my expertise in centralized management, I implemented Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for controlling security settings, software installations, and system configurations across the network.</p>
- <b>Security and Access Controls:</b> <p>Security is a paramount concern in modern IT environments. I implemented robust security measures, including firewalls, access controls, and intrusion detection systems, to safeguard the AD environment.</p>
- <b>Integration with DNS and DHCP:</b> <p>I integrated DNS and DHCP services into the Active Directory infrastructure, ensuring seamless name resolution and IP address management.</p>
- <b>Monitoring and Troubleshooting:</b> <p>I utilized monitoring tools and troubleshooting techniques to diagnose and resolve issues within the AD environment, emphasizing proactive system maintenance.</p>
